# Summary #

This is a Java application tool to design castle layouts for the game http://www.strongholdkingdoms.com/.

Designs are saved as images for easy access, and barcoded to allow the image to be loaded.
An alphanumeric version of the barcode can also be exported/imported.

# Details #

  * Buildings are placed quickly and efficiently by dragging the mouse.
  * Buildings can be removed in the same way with the right mouse button.
  * Designs are saved in a lossless png format.
  * The saved images can be reloaded back into the designer since each image has its information barcoded for forwards compatibility.
  * For when images cannot be used (such as the Stronghold Kingdoms ingame mail system), an alphanumeric version of the barcode may be accessed.
